## Week 1 - History
- One writing system can be used by many languages
- Cuneiform looks weird
- The Epic of Gilgamesh was epic
## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- It is simpler to work with only two distinct values or states
- Computer systems have two main types of memory: Volatile (short-term) with RAM and Non-volatile (long-term/persistent storage) with HDDs and SSDs
- We measure memory and storage capacity using units based on bytes, typically using metric prefixes: Kilobyte (thousand), Megabyte (million), Gigabyte (billion), Terabyte (trillion)
- Binary = positions represent powers of 2; Base 2
- Unsigned integers = range from 0 (all bits 0) to 255 (all bits 1) with 8 bits/1 byte representing 2^8 = 256 different values
- Larger numbers = use multiple bytes; 2 bytes/16 bits can represent 2^16 = 65536 different values, ranging from 0 to 65535 = unsigned integers
- For 8-bit signed integer = range of representable numbers = -128 to +127 (allows for 256 distinct values, just shifted to include negative numbers)
- Computer memory is a vast, linear sequence of bytes
- ASCII table = system to map numbers (bytes) to characters (letters, digits, symbols)
- Files can be categorized based on how bytes are intended to be interpreted: Text vs. Binary files
- Positional number systems = value of digit depends on its position within the number
- Base/radix of system = number of unique digits it uses: Decimal (Base 10), Octal (Base 8), Hexadecimal (Base 16)
## Week 3 - Text Structure
- Historical examples: Ancient manuscripts and early printing, Ledgers and tables, Newspapers
- Computing text structure: Lines, Whitespace, Paragraphs
- Special characters: Punctuation, Mathematical/Operational symbols, Brackets and braces, Others like dollar and hash sign
- Markup languages and Markdown processor
- Structured Data like Javascript Object Notation (JSON)
- Human readability vs. Machine readability
- Escaping special characters
## Week 4 - Text and Text Editors
- Still need desk setup and tools (keyboard main interface)
- Mastering keyboard through touch typing increases speed, reduces cognitive load, and improves comfort and flow
- Different aspects of keyboard layout: physical layout, visual labelling, and functional (software) layout
- No single "best" keyboard
- Ergonomics and health
- Programmable keyboards
- Distinguish between word processors and text editors
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): text editor with suite of tools designed for software development
- Most popular text editor today = Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Crucial skill = efficiently finding and changing text within files
- Advanced searching: wildcards and regular expressions (regex)
## Week 5 - Command Line Interfaces
- Way of interacting with computer by typing text commands = powerful and essential tool for software developers
- Concept dates back to earliest forms of computer interaction
- Interaction model = very similar to talking to chatbot
- Distinct structure = prompt, command, argument, option/flag, cursor
- Usage = speed, precise control, automation (scripting), low resource usage, etc.
- Remote access with SSH
- Bandit game
- CLI concepts and commands = file system navigation and manipulation
